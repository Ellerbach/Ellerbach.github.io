This blog regroup technical articles which I have published over time. This blog is a migration of an existing blog up to 2018. I kept only the technical articles and removed the non technical ones. So please note that some links may be broken. Please don't hesitate to report them to me.

And I kept only articles with high traffic (more than couple of thousands of page views and more than few hundreds of page view per month).

It is surprising to see that some (very) old articles still have decent traffic.

The 2021+ articles are new ones!
