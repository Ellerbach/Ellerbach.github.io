So as I got lots of asks to get the code of my Web Server, I’ve decided to create a Codeplex project. You’ll find the source here: [https://netmfwebserver.codeplex.com/](https://netmfwebserver.codeplex.com/)

 It does include the following features:

  
  * Start, stop, Pause the Web Server 
  * Creation of a Web Server on any port 
  * Fully functional multithread Web Server supporting GET only 
  * Downloading any file present on a SD (or any other physical storage) 
  * A full function to get all the parameters of a URL  Examples of usage can be found on this blog. Working to publish a fully functional example.

 Feedback welcome!
