I realize I haven’t posted on my blog the direct link to the porting of .NET Microframework (NETMF) to the RaspberryPi. See [previous article]({% post_url 2013-06-21-.NET-Microframework-on-RaspberryPi-(Part-1) %}).

 So code is available here: [https://raspberrypinetmf.codeplex.com/](https://raspberrypinetmf.codeplex.com/). This is not a full port of NETMF natively on RaspberryPi. It’s a port of specific NETMF classes on Mono running on Linux. It can be useful to quickly port existing NETMF projects with very little or no modifications. Note also that some classes are missing. So don’t hesitate to participate.

 Enjoy!
