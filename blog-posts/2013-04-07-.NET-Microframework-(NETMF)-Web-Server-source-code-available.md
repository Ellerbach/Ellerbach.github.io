# 2013-04-07 .NET Microframework (NETMF) Web Server source code available

So as I got lots of asks to get the code of my Web Server, I've decided to create a Codeplex project. Edit from original: The Web Server has now moved to server .NET nanoFramework, it's still the work from the original .NET Microframework which is used: [nanoFramework.WebServer](https://github.com/nanoframework/nanoFramework.WebServer).

 It does include the following features:

* Start, stop, Pause the Web Server
* Creation of a Web Server on any port
* Fully functional multithread Web Server supporting GET only
* Downloading any file present on a SD (or any other physical storage)
* A full function to get all the parameters of a URL  Examples of usage can be found on this blog. Working to publish a fully functional example.

 Feedback welcome!
